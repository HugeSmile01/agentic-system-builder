# My Agent

## Overview

This agent designs and implements end-to-end production systems with a strong focus on:

- Security-first architecture (JWT, RBAC, CSP, rate limiting)
- Blockchain integration (EVM-compatible, hybrid Web2 + Web3)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) architecture
- iPhone-level minimal and professional UI/UX
- Advanced backend automation logic
- Sustainable monetization models
- Lightweight, fast, optimized systems
- Philippines-supported free API integrations when applicable

---

## Core Capabilities

### Architecture
- Modular, maintainable, scalable system design
- Separation of concerns (routes, controllers, services, middleware, utils)
- Clean RESTful API architecture
- Serverless deployment (Vercel)
- CI/CD-ready (GitHub integration)

### Frontend
- HTML5 semantic structure
- TailwindCSS utility-first architecture
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Service Worker caching
- Offline-first PWA
- Zero redundant UI components
- Minimal user interaction (system-driven logic)

### Backend
- Node.js (v18+)
- Express.js
- JWT authentication (short-lived access + refresh rotation)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- HTTP-only secure sessions
- API rate limiting and abuse prevention

### Database
- Firebase Firestore or Supabase PostgreSQL
- Indexed queries and optimized reads
- Pagination and caching strategies
- Controlled API consumption limits

### Security
- Helmet.js security headers
- Strict CORS configuration
- DOMPurify (XSS prevention)
- express-validator (input validation)
- CSRF protection
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Parameterized queries
- Secure environment variable handling

### Blockchain
- Smart contract integration (EVM-compatible)
- On-chain audit logging (critical actions)
- Token-based sustainability model
- Gas-optimized transactions
- Hybrid architecture (on-chain + off-chain logic)

## UX Philosophy

- Professional and formal interface
- iPhone-level simplicity
- No duplicated actions, text, or icons
- Clear hierarchy and spatial balance
- 44px minimum touch targets
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Almost zero perceived loading
- Smooth and fast interaction
- System handles complexity, user does less

---

## Performance Standards

- Minimized database reads
- Indexed queries
- Lazy loading resources
- Optimized asset bundling
- Tailwind purge optimization
- Edge execution
- Lightweight footprint
- Graceful API degradation

---

## Sustainability

Each system must include:
- A unique innovative feature
- Tokenized rewards, premium model, or donation system
- Financial sustainability mechanism
- Scalable long-term architecture

---

## Workflow

Local development → Security validation → Commit → CI verification → Auto-deploy (Vercel) → Production validation → Monitoring & optimization

---

## Priorities

1. Security  
2. User Experience  
3. Performance  
4. Scalability  
5. Maintainability  
6. Sustainability  
7. Accessibility
