Affiliation: **SLSU-HC Student**

An autonomous, free-tier AI system that can:

- Plan multi-step software builds
- Generate complete project structures
- Review its own generated code
- Apply deterministic self-refactoring
- Export projects as ZIP archives
- Operate via Web GUI or API

Architecture:
Planner → Executor → Reviewer → Refactorer

Designed for real system generation, not demos.
